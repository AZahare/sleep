        <p>“Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent gain,” says sleep scientist Matthew Walker. Indeed, you may wish to read just a couple more pages (or chapters) in this enthralling book or maybe you want to watch just one more Youtube video (it's not that long, is it?), or simply finish this one thing, or... and whether intentionally or unintentionally you have robbed yourself of valuable sleeping time. And it is such a shame as the benefits of sleep are so vast that you could probably call sleeping your superpower. That is if you get enough of it.</p>
       
        <h2>What happens when you sleep?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your brain replays memory sequences you learn while awake, i.e., you are practicing and perfecting your skills even though it looks as if you are doing nothing.</li>
            <li>The information that you knew before is combined with new information that was learned during the day, thus new connections and associations are formed.
                <br>
                (This is the reason why in the morning you might easily solve problems that previously seemed to be unsolvable.)
            </li>
            <li>Sleep has a powerful effect on the immune system, it is not for nothing that there is an expression “healing sleep”.
            <br>
            The less sleep you get the more likely you are to catch a cold.
            </li>
            <li>Brain is cleansed of all the metabolic toxins that have accumulated throughout the day.
                <br>
                One of those toxins is beta amyloid, this toxin is responsible for the underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.
            </li>
            <li>Deep sleep regulates insulin levels and blood glucose levels, it is also is one of the best blood pressure medications you can imagine.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to fall asleep easier?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Regularity is the key – you should go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (yes - this does include weekends). </li>
            <li>Stay away from screens during the last hour of your day.</li>
            <li>Keep your room cool (your brain needs to drop its temperature by a couple degrees in order to fall asleep).</li>
            <li>Do not go to bed too full, and do not go to bed hungry.</li>
            <li>Avoid caffeine within 6–8 hours before bedtime.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>How much sleep do you need?</h2>
        <p>Most likely – more than you are getting. An adult needs 7–9 hours of sleep a night. It has been proven by scientists that if you are getting less than 7 hours of sleep you are sleep deprived.</p>
        <p>“The number of people who can survive on 6 hours of sleep or less, rounded to a whole number, and expressed as a percentage of the population is 0.” (Matthew Walker)</p>

        <p>All the information mentioned above and much, much more can be found in Matthew Walker's book “Why We Sleep. The New Science of Sleep and Dreams”. It is a popular science book that will forever change your attitude towards sleep. Despite dealing with complex neurological phenomena Walker's explanations while oftentimes being slightly sarcastic are easy to understand.</p>
        <p>Still not convinced you should invest your time in reading it? Check out the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review" target="_blank">review</a> by The Guardian.</p>

        <p>The book has been recently translated and Latvian version called “Kāpēc mēs guļam?” is now available in bookstores. So if you prefer reading in Latvian or if you like to amuse yourself by comparing translations to originals you are in luck.</p>
